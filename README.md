# **Introduction**

This Jupyter notebook is part of your learning experience in the study of central tendency

We will work with a simple data set that contains details of wine quality

In this exercise, we will perform the following tasks:

1 - Load and study the data

2 - View the distributions of the various features in the data set and calculate their central tendencies

3 - Create a new Pandas Series that contains the details of the representative factor for quality

# **Task 1** - Load and study the data

Load the data and study its features such as:

* fixed acidity

* volatile acidity

* citric acid etc.

# **Task 2** - View the distributions of the various features in the data set and calculate their central tendencies

We will now look at the distributions of the various features in the data set

We will also calculate appropriate measures of central tendency for these features

# **Task 3** - Create a new Pandas Series that contains the details of the acid types for a quality

We will now create a Pandas Series that contains the representative values for each of the features

## **Final Conclusions**

* From the given data, we can use simple visualisations to get a sense of how data are distributed.

* We can use various measures of central tendency such as mean, median and mode to represent a group of observations.

* The type of central tendency measure to use depends on the type and the distribution of the data
